# Neighborhoods in San Francisco with the Fastest Emergency Response Times

## Introduction
This aspect of the project analyzes the emergency response times across different neighborhoods in San Francisco to identify which areas have the fastest responses to medical and traffic collision incidents.
Using data from the San Franscico Service Calls and neighborhoods within regions, we have determine the average times of medical response in San Fransisco.

## Datasets
This analysis is based on the datasets in Google BigQuery: 'bigquery-public-data.san_francisco.sffd_service_calls' and 'bigquery-public-data.san_francisco_neighborhoods.boundaries'.


## SQL Queries
### 1. Average Response Time by ZipCode
This query calculates the average total response time for medical incidents in each zip code.
### 2. Neighborhood Coordinates
This query retrieves the latitude and longitude coordinates of a medical and traffic collision response service and maps it to its respective neighborhood.
### 3. Average Response Time by Neighborhood
This query computes the average response time for incidents within specific neighborhoods.
### 4. Optimized Response Time by Neighborhood
To enhance the efficiency of our data analysis, we have implemented a partitioned table that organizes the received_timestamp by month. This table specifically includes only those attributes that are essential for our analysisâ€”such as received_timestamp, on_scene_timestamp, zipcode_of_incident, longitude, latitude, and call_type. This leads to lower costs and speeds up query execution.
